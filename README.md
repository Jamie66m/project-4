# Birdie Time

## Overview

Birdie Time was the fourth and final project that I completed during the Software Engineering Course. It is a full-stack desktop web application with a React.js front-end, a Django-Python back-end, and a PostgreSQL database.

This was a week long project and we had the option as a cohort to do it in groups or individually. I decided to do the project solo for a couple of reasons. I was eager to produce an application on a topic that I was very passionate about and secondly I was very keen to really understand where my skill level had got to over the three month course in order that when the course had finished I knew what areas I need to work on and improve. Lastly I didn't do a huge amount of work on the backend for my third project and I was keen to work and understand databases. 

Birdie Time is looking to take golf lovers on a journey to playing the top 50 golf courses in the UK & Northern Ireland. The inspiration to make a golf based app is because of my own love for the game and also due to the fact that the world of golf is definitely evolving with the current times and is probably the latest sport to be making moves and evolving through technological advancements.  

Birdie Time is going to be a 3 stage process and during the week long time-frame I completed the first stage. The first concept is to provide the user with a great amount of detail and all the relevant information on the top 50 courses as well as allowing the user to interact with each course. The second stage is for users to be able to follow each other, match based on handicap levels and compare scores, match based on the location of their local course and join virtual golf clubs where they can discuss courses and arrange times to play with each other. Lastly is for users to have their golf swing analysed and commented on by an online instructor.

Due to the scale of the project and the time limit of a week I have produced the foundations of the project and have so far only covered the first concept. The application was created using a Django-Python backend, React-JavaScript frontend as well as PostgreSql. I was unable to use an external API for this project and therefore I knew in my backend there were going to be many relationships and tables in the database I was creating. Due to the level of detail I wanted to provide for each course, to ensure the best possible user experience I knew that I would have to spend a significant amount of the project time creating the API and furthermore, to then generate all the data myself. The user can add these courses to wishlist, make it their home course or state they have played the course. 

I am looking forward to building the other two concepts of the project and also gather information from the golfing community on what they would like from a golf inspired web application.
